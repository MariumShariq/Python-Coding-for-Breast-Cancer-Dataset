Project Goal:
The aim of this project is to clean and analyze a breast cancer dataset using Python, with a focus on handling missing data, renaming columns for consistency, and creating visualizations for insights. The project also explores descriptive statistics for protein expression and age distribution.

Benefits to the Industry:
This project provides a robust method for preprocessing healthcare data, making it easier for medical professionals and researchers to draw meaningful insights from large datasets. The visualizations can assist in understanding patient demographics, treatment types, and outcomes, which could potentially enhance patient care and treatment plans.

Python Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
pyspan: To handle missing data and apply column renames.
matplotlib: For creating bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.
plotly.express: Used for interactive data visualization.
Target Audience:

Data analysts working in the healthcare sector.
Healthcare professionals interested in leveraging data for decision-making.
Data science students or enthusiasts looking for practical examples of healthcare data analysis.
